<p> <strong> Volunteering Flexibility? </strong><br>
Currently, I volunteer on some weekdays at a Food Share in Fort Collins - I'd like to inquire about flexibility regarding this so that I might still be able to volunteer?
</p>
<p> <strong> Hybrid Flexibility? </strong><br>
According to the Job Posting, this position may be eligible for the CU Hybrid Work Policy. I have previous experience working remotely while I was employed at CU as well, so I would hope there may be an option with this as well? (Past initial training, etc)
