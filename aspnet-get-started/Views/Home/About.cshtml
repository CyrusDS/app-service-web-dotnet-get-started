Who We Are
The ITL Program at CU Boulder is a nationally recognized engineering education
leader. Our mission is to provide curriculum and support for hands-on engineering
education, across all engineering subject areas, for students from kindergarten to
graduate school (K-22), with a focus on students from underserved populations and
communities. We operate the 35,000 square-foot Integrated Teaching and Learning
Laboratory on the Boulder campus, where we support hands-on experiences for over
3,500 undergraduate and graduate students each year. We also lead and manage
TeachEngineering.org and the Denver-Metro Engineering Consortium (DMEC).
TeachEngineering.org is a NSF-funded digital library that provides free, hands-on K-12
STEM curriculum to over 2.5M educators annually. The DMEC is a DoD-funded
partnership between CU Boulder, CU Denver, and five community colleges in the
Denver-Metro area to increase the number of students from underrepresented groups
earning associate degrees and transferring to undergraduate engineering programs.
The ITL Program is committed to honoring unique backgrounds and experiences. Join
our team and help us build a more inclusive and diverse academic and engineering
culture – apply today!
